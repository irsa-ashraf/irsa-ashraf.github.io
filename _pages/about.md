I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago pursuing a [Masters in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) jointly offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Harris School of Public Policy. 
My interests lie at the itnersection of machine learning, product analytics and technology policy. 
A self-taught Data Analyst, I worked in the private sector primarily on sales forecasting, retail analytics and inventory analysis. Prior to this, I interned at the United Nations Executive Office of the Secretary-General and was part of the team that helped implement the [Strategy on New Technologies](https://www.un.org/en/newtechnologies/). 
In the summer after my first year of graduate school, I worked on risk modelling at a cybersecurity company. 
Some projects I have worked on range from forecasting crime in Chicago, clustering songs based on audio features using unsupervised learning, analysing and visualizing Yelp reviews for restaurants in New York City and building the back-end of a software-as-a-service gene annotation application using AWS and Flask, to mention just a few. 
I have a background in Economics and Global Studies through a B.A. in Economics from UCLA. 
In my free time, I like experimetning with simple high protein recipes, going out to eat (especially for brunch), staying active by biking and strength training, and spending time with my family and close friends.
