In this project, I delve into the gastronomic scene of one of the busiest and liveliest cities in the world. With over 24,000 restaurants, New York tops the list for the city with the most restaurants. For context, you can eat at a different restaurant every day for approximately 22 years without going to the same place twice.

This project was born out of a personal interest in the topic. New York is my favourite city and I absolutely love walking around the city and stumbling upon restaurants and cafes that I have not been to before. Therefore, I was genuinely curious to see how New Yorkers eat - particularly, what their preferred cuisines are, how much they’re willing to spend and how they rate different food.

* Data Source: Yelp
  Using the Yelp Fusion API, I scraped Yelp data on businesses labelled as ‘restaurants’ and that had their location labelled as ‘New York City'
